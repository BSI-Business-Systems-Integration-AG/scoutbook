\chapter{Scout Runtime}
\chalabel{runtime}

One of the primary goals of the Scout runtime framework is to let the application developer focus on implementing business requirements. 
To support this goal, Scout covers most recurring aspects of business applications from the user interface to the integration of backend services. 
To clearly state the boundary of the scope of the framework, the integration of Scout application in a typical enterprise setup is discussed in the following section.

\secref{application_architecture} describes the architecture of typical Scout applications including both the server and clients.

The scope of the Scout framework is best explained in the context of an enterprise setup as shown in \figref{scout_integration_enterprise}. 
From

not persistence, not business entity modeling, not ?
but user interaction handling, business rules, accessing existing services offered through enterprise service bus, transparent client server communication

\section{Multi-Frontend Support}

two important aspects: 1) same app running on many devices 2) effective risk reduction strategy: no mixing of business logic an ui tech code, deciding for the 'wrong' framwork not so bad any more

\section{The Scout Client}

 large collection of mature UI components.
 Scout supports various UI technologies out of the box. 
 Depending on your needs, you decide to build applications for
mobile devices, the browser or the desktop. Mobile and
web applications are based on Eclipse RAP. Desktop clients
are based on either Swing or SWT.

\section{The Scout Server}

For seamless integration into a service-oriented IT architecture, Scout offers direct support for Web services based on
JAX-WS. To access relational databases other than Apache
Derby, connectors are also available for non-EPL compatible databases such as Oracle, MySql, PostgreSQL or DB2
