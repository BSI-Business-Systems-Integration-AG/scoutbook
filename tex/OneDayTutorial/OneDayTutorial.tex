\chapter{A Larger Example}
\chalabel{large_example}

In this chapter we will create a small Scout application that covers additional aspects of the Eclipse Scout framework. 
Specifically, we will build an outline based Scout application featuring a navigation tree and pages to present information in tabular form. 
In addition, the application also shows how to work with menus and context menus, search forms, and forms to enter and/or update data. 
On the server side we show how to work with databases, how to use logging in Scout applications and how to include standard Java libraries. 

This chapter is organized as follows.
First, the finished demo application is explained from the user perspective.
Then bla.
