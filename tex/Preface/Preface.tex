\section*{The Scout Community}

The community around Scout is its most valuable asset.
It is active, growing and friendly.
This is why it deserves to be mentionend right here.
The Scout forum\footnote{Scout forum \url{http://www.eclipse.org/forums/eclipse.scout}} is the central place for the Scout community to share ideas, ask questions and get help. 
Other, less interactive community resources are the Scout wiki 
pages\footnote{Scout wiki \url{http://wiki.eclipse.org/scout}}, the Scout 
homepage\footnote{Scout homepage \url{http://www.eclipse.org/scout}}, 
the blog\footnote{Scout blog \url{http://www.bsiag.com/scout}}, and 
twitter\footnote{Scout twitter \url{http://twitter.com/EclipseScout}}.

The simplest way to become a community member yourself is to start with downloading
Scout from the Eclipse download site\footnote{Scout download \url{http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/}}, 
installing the software as described in \appref{install_scout}, and continue reading here.
