After the initial project creation step we are ready to start the server and the clients of the still empty Scout application.
For this, we switch to the Scout Explorer and select the root node \element{org.eclipse.scout.helloworld}.
Selecting the application's root node in the Scout Explorer then loads the available information and controls into the \textit{Scout Object Properties} view as shown in \figref{sdk_initial_helloworld_project}.

In the product launcher section of the Scout Object Properties view four launcher boxes are available. 
One launcher box for the Scout server product, and three launchers for the different client products.
Each launcher provides a link to the corresponding Eclipse configuration and product definition files, as well as launcher icons to start and stop the corresponding application.
The green \icon{Circle} starts the product in normal mode.
The \icon{Bug} just below, starts a product in debug mode.
To terminate a running product, the red \icon{Square} is provided. 

Before any of the client products is started, we need to start the server product using the green circle or the bug launcher icon.
During startup of the Scout server you should see console output similar to the one shown on the right hand side of \figref{start_client}.

\end{figure}

Once the server is running, you may start the web client as shown in \figref{start_client}.
To start the Swing client, or the SWT client use the corresponding green \icon{Circle} or \icon{Bug}.
And with a running RAP client, the Scout web client can be opened in a web browser by clicking on the provided \link{Automatic Device Dispatch}.
Alternatively, open a a browser and manually type the address \texttt{http://localhost:8082/web} into the browser's navigation bar.

Having started the Scout server and all client products, the client applications should become visible as shown in \figref{helloworld_empty}.
