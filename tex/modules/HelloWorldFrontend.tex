The project creation step has created a Scout client that displays an empty desktop form.
We will now add widgets to the client's desktop form that will later display the ''Hello World!'' message.

To add any widgets to the desktop form we first need to navigate to the \element{DesktopForm} in the Scout Explorer.
By clicking on the small triangle icon on the left hand side of the \element{DesktopForm} this element is expanded and the \element{MainBox} element becomes visible below.
With a click of the right mouse button over the \element{MainBox}, the available context menus are displayed.
To start the form field wizard we select the \menu{New Form Field ...} as shown in \figref{new_field_context_menu}.

\figlabel{new_field_context_menu}
\end{figure}

% In the steps described below, we use the \wizard{New Form Field} provided by the Scout SDK. 
% First, we add a group box field to the desktop form.
% Then, we apply this wizard a second time to add the actual text widget\footnote{
% Adding top level group boxes to a form helps in structuring the form layout, especially when a form contains a large number of form fields.
% }.
%Before we add the actual text field widget to the desktop form, we create a group box widget that will later contain the text field. 

In the first step of the form field wizard shown on in \figref{helloworld_groupboxfield} we choose \java{GroupBox} as the form field type.
In the second wizard step, we enter 'Desktop' into the \field{Class Name} before we close the wizard with the \button{Finish}.
The Scout SDK will then add the necessary Java code for the \java{DesktopBox} in the background.

\figlabel{helloworld_groupboxfield}
\end{figure}

We can now add the text field widget to the group box just created.
To do this, we first expand the \element{MainBox} in the Scout Explorer view. 
This expands the main box node and makes the \element{DesktopBox} element visible.
On the \element{DesktopBox} we can again use the \menu{New Form Field ...}.
In the first wizard step, we select \element{StringField} as the form field type and click the \button{Next}.
In the second wizard step, we enter 'Message' into the \field{Name}.

As we do not yet have the text 'Message' available in our ''Hello World'' application the wizard prompts the user with the proposal \textsc{New Translated Text ...}.
With a double click on this option a new text entry can be added to the application as shown in \figref{helloworld_stringfield}.
Once we have provided some initial translation for our message label, we can close the translation dialog with the \button{Ok}.
Finally, we close the form field wizard using the \button{Finish}.

\figlabel{helloworld_stringfield}
\end{figure}

By expanding the \element{DesktopBox} element in the Scout Explorer, the new message field becomes visible. 
A double click on the message field element then loads the corresponding Java code into an Editor and displays the message field's properties in the Scout Object Properties as shown in \figref{helloworld_messagefield}.
This is a good moment to compare your status with this screenshot.
Make sure that both the Java code and the project structure in the Scout Explorer look as shown in \figref{helloworld_messagefield}.

\end{figure}

Having verified your status of the ''Hello World'' application you can start the application as described in the previous section.
The client applications will then display your message widget.
However, the text widget is still empty, as we did not yet load any initial content into it.
This is the topic of the next section where we continue the tutorial with the server part.
