The project creation step has created a Scout client that displays an empty desktop form.
We will now add widgets to the client's desktop form that will later display the ''Hello World!'' message.

To add any widgets to the desktop form, navigate to the \element{DesktopForm} in the Scout Explorer.
For this, click on the orange client node in the Scout Explorer view.
Then, expand the \element{Forms} folder by clicking on the small triangle icon, and further expand the \element{DesktopForm}. 
As a result, the \element{MainBox} element becomes visible below the desktop form as shown in \figref{new_field_context_menu}. 
With a click of the right mouse button over the \element{MainBox}, the available context menus are displayed.
To start the form field wizard select the \menu{New Form Field ...}.

\figlabel{new_field_context_menu}
\end{figure}

In the first step of the form field wizard shown on in \figref{helloworld_groupboxfield} choose \java{GroupBox} as the form field type and click on the \button{Next}.
In the second wizard step, enter 'Desktop' into the \field{Class Name} before you close the wizard with the \button{Finish}.
The Scout SDK will then add the necessary Java code for the \java{DesktopBox} in the background.

\end{figure}

We can now add the text field widget to the group box just created.
To do this, expand the \element{MainBox} in the Scout Explorer view to access the newly created \element{DesktopBox} element. 
On the \element{DesktopBox} use the \menu{New Form Field ...} again.
In the first wizard step, select \element{StringField} as the form field type according to \figref{helloworld_stringfield}. 
To select the \element{StringField} type you can either scroll down the list of available types or enter ''st'' into the field above the field type list. 
In the second wizard step, enter 'Message' into the \field{Label}.
As we do not yet have the text 'Message' available in our ''Hello World'' application the wizard prompts the user with the proposal \textsc{New Translated Text ...}.

\figlabel{helloworld_stringfield}
\end{figure}

With a double click on this option a new text entry can be added to the application as shown in \figref{helloworld_text_entry}.
Once an initial translation for the message label is provided, close the translation dialog with the \button{Ok}.
Finally, close the form field wizard using the \button{Finish}.

\figlabel{helloworld_text_entry}
\end{figure}

By expanding the \element{DesktopBox} element in the Scout Explorer, the new message field becomes visible. 
Now, double click on the message field element to load the corresponding Java code into an editor and displays the message field's properties in the Scout Object Properties as shown in \figref{helloworld_messagefield}.
This is a good moment to compare your status with this screenshot.
Make sure that both the Java code and the project structure in the Scout Explorer look as shown in \figref{helloworld_messagefield}.

\end{figure}

Having verified your status of the ''Hello World'' application start the start the server and a client of the application as described in the previous section.
The client applications will then display your message widget.
However, the text widget is still empty, as we did not yet load any initial content into this field.
This is the topic of the next section.
