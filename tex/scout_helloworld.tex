\section*{The Scout ''Hello World!''}

After installing the Eclipse Scout package you are now ready to implement your first Scout application.

\section*{Run the Final Application}

We are now ready to run the completed ''Hello World!'' application by first starting the server and then the clients. 
This results in running clients as shown in \figref{helloworld_finished}. 
The mobile version of the client can be started from the Scout SDK by clicking on the \link{Smartphone Devices} in the product launchers section. 
Alternatively, manually change the applications URL from \java{http://localhost:8082/web} to \java{http://localhost:8082/mobile}.

Congratulations, you just have implemented your first Scout client server application!
