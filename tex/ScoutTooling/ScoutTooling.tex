\chapter{Scout Tooling}
\chalabel{tooling}

In addition to the Scout runtime framework presented in the previous chapter, Eclipse Scout also includes a comprehensive tooling, the Scout SDK. 
Thanks to this tooling, developing Scout applications is made simpler, more productive and also more robust. 
Initially, a solid understanding of the Java language is sufficient to start developing Scout applications and only a rough understanding of the underlying Eclipse/OSGi/JEE technologies is required. 

The Scout SDK consists of navigation support for the application model defined by the Scout runtime and provides many intuitive component wizards. 
This creates an ideal environment to beginners for building complete, high-quality Scout applications. 
Typically, Java developers only need a few days of Scout training to start creating their own advanced client server business applications. 

The Scout SDK also helps developers to become more productive.
Many repetitive and error prone tasks run automatically in the background or are taken care of by the component wizards of the Scout SDK. 
This starts with the initial creation of a Scout client server application, continues with the wizards to create complete dialogs and pages and includes the automatic management of the data transfer objects needed by the client server communication.

Finally, the application code created by the Scout SDK wizards helps to ensure that the resulting Scout application has a consistent and robust code base and is well aligned with the application model defined by the Scout runtime framework.

% --------------------------------------------------------------------------- %
\section{The Scout SDK}

The Scout SDK is added to the Eclipse IDE in the form of the Scout perspective\footnote{
See \appref{eclipse_perspective} for additional information regarding Eclipse IDE perspectives. 
}.
With the Scout Explorer and Scout Objects Properties, two view parts are contained in the Scout perspective. 
Additionally, the Scout SDK contains a comprehensive set of wizards that support the developer in creating Scout application components. 

The Scout Explorer view allows the developer to navigate the complete Scout application model. 
Once an element in the Scout Explorer is selected, the Scout Object properties view allows to view and change selected properties of the selected element. 
Depending on the selected element in the Scout Explorer, the Scout SDK offers appropriate context menues to start the related wizards.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=14cm]{scout_sdk_perspective.png} 
\caption{The Scout SDK perspective. On the left hand side the Eclipse Scout Explorer and the Scout Object Properties view are visible.}
\figlabel{scout_sdk_perspective}
\end{figure}

\figref{scout_sdk_perspective} provides a screenshot of the Scout SDK perspective. 
In the Eclipse Scout Explorer shown in the upper left part of the screenshot, the message field in the desktop form of the ''Hello World'' application is selected. 
In the Scout Object Properties located below, the message field's appearance, layout and behaviour properties are displayed. 
On the right side, the corresponding source code is loaded in a Java editor. 

When the developer changes a property of the selected element, the Java code is updated accordingly. 
For example, clicking the \property{Mandatory} in the Scout Object Properties of the message field will insert the method \java{getConfiguredLabel} to the message field's class. 
This demonstrates how the Scout SDK directly works on the Java source code. 
In fact, the Java source code is the only artefact relevant for the Scout SDK to 'understand' the Scout application model. 
Taking advantage of this setup, the Scout SDK implements a full round-trip-engineering from creating the Java code for Scout application components, parsing code changes in the background, and displaying the current implementation of the Scout application in the Scout Explorer and the Scout Object Properties.

Thanks to the round-trip-engineering provided by the Scout SDK, the information presented in the Scout Explorer and the Scout Object Properties always stay in sync with the Java code of the Scout application.
To illustrate this, we will re-use the ''Hello World'' Scout project from \charef{helloworld}. 
Start the Eclipse IDE with the workspace containing the ''Hello World'' application.
Then, navigate to method \java{getConfiguredLabel} as shown in \figref{scout_sdk_perspective}, and add the java snippet shown below to the class \java{MessageField}. 

\begin{lstlisting}[backgroundcolor=\color{white}]
    @Override
    protected boolean getConfiguredMandatory() {
        return true;
    }
\end{lstlisting}

After having saved the code change, you can observe that the \property{Mandatory} in the section Behaviour of the message field's Scout Object properties has changed its state. 
The font of its label is now presented in bold face and underlined, the checkbox is ticked and a red minus icon is shown on the right side of the property. 
Obviously, the Scout SDK is directly operating on the project's source code and does not rely or need any external meta data. 
This provides the flexibility to develop Scout applications with or without the support of the Scout SDK. 
And this choice offered to the Scout developer is one of the most important features provided by the Scout SDK. 
The Scout developer may take advantage of the development support provided by the Scout SDK without being restricted by the Scout tooling in any way.

Technically, the Scout SDK is a set of Eclipse plugins that operate on top of the Eclipse JDT and the Eclipse PDE projects.
The Java Development Tools (JDT)\footnote{
See the Eclipse JDT project page for details: \url{http://www.eclipse.org/jdt/}.
} 
contain a Java IDE supporting the development of any Java application, 
and the Plugin Development Environment (PDE)\footnote{
See the Eclipse PDE project page for details: \url{http://www.eclipse.org/pde/}.
}
provides tools to create, develop, test, debug, build and deploy Eclipse plugins, and additional artefacts relevant for Eclipse based applications. 
As in the case of the Scout Runtime, the plugins representing the Scout SDK, the JDT and the PDE are all located in the \filename{plugins} directory your Eclipse installation and named \filename{org.eclipse.scout.sdk.*}, \filename{org.eclipse.jdt.*} and \filename{org.eclipse.pde.*} . 

% --------------------------------------------------------------------------- %
\section{The Scout Explorer}

The Scout Explorer view is responsible for the navigation support within the Scout application model. 
This navigation support is presented in the form of a tree view and includes the client with its UI components, the server and the shared part of a Scout application. 
It also includes all Scout application modules of modular Scout applications\footnote{
See \secref{multi_module_apps} for more information regarding multi module Scout applications.
}.
For the actual navigation in the tree representing the Scout application both the mouse or the keyborad can be used. 

To expand or collapse a selected node in the Scout Explorer, you may click on the tiny \icon{plus} or the \icon{minus} presented to the left of the node.
Alternatively, you can also use the \key{Right} or the \key{Left}.

Once a node in the tree is selected, the Scout Object Properties view presents the associated configuration of the selected element. 
If the selected element represents a specific application model component, the corresponding Java source code can be accessed through a double click on the node, or hitting the \key{Enter}. 

The navigation tree provided in the Scout Explorer view also allows the developer to add elements to your application.
Depending on the selected node in the tree, the Scout SDK allows to start the applicable Scout SDK wizards using corresponding context menus. 
The wizards support the creation of application components, such as dialogues on the client side or services on the server side by generating the necessary Java code.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=6.5cm]{explorer_client.png} 
\caption{The Scout Explorer view. The white nodes below the expanded client node represent the supported UI technologies.}
\figlabel{explorer_client}
\end{figure}

In \figref{explorer_client} the top level organisation of the client application model is shown as it is represented in the Scout Explorer.
All client specific elements are located under the selected orange client node \element{org.eclipsescout.helloworld.client}. 
Right below, the three white UI plugins are located that represent the support for the corresponding UI technolgies for Swing, SWT and Eclipse RAP. 
The orange \node{org.eclipsescout.helloworld.client.mobile} contains all elements that are specific to mobile devices such as the \java{MobileHomeForm}

Specific nodes for the client session and the desktop of the Scout client allow access to the corresponding Scout application model components. 
While the client session is the main entry point for client-server communication, the desktop represents the root component of the visible part of a Scout client applications. 
Below, a set of folders group additional client model components according to their type. 
The forms folder for example holds all available forms, such as the desktop form that we have seen in the ''Hello World!'' tutorial\footnote{
See \secref{initial_helloworld} for a description of many of these elements.
}. 

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=7cm]{explorer_shared.png} 
\caption{The Scout Explorer view with the expanded shared node.}
\figlabel{explorer_shared}
\end{figure}

A screenshot of the expanded green shared node \element{org.eclipsescout.helloworld.} is provided in \figref{explorer_shared}. 
As the name ''shared'' suggests, the corresponding plugin holds all application components that are required for both the Scout client and the Scout server application. 
This includes texts, icons, enumeration or codes, permissions, lookup calls. 
As shown in \figref{explorer_shared}, a separate folder for each resource type is provided under the shared node.
 
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[height=6.8cm]{explorer_server.png} \hspace{5mm} 
\includegraphics[height=6.8cm]{explorer_server_servicewizard.png}
\caption{The Scout Explorer view with the expanded server node (left). On the individual nodes, access to the relevant Scout SDK wizards is provided via context menues (right).}
\figlabel{explorer_server}
\end{figure}

In \figref{explorer_server}, the blue server node is expanded in the Scout Explorer view. 
As the primary responsibility of the Scout server application is dealing with requests, its components are mostly related to different types of services. 
Below the server session node, the \folder{Services} holds services related to the processing logic of the application such as retrieving and updating data. 
The remaining folder group differnt more specific types of server services. 
Under the \folder{Webservices} the Scout SDK support to provide and consume web services is located. 

The right side of \figref{explorer_server} illustrates the access to the Scout SDK wizards via corresponding context menus. 
The \menu{New Service...} shown in the screenshot will start the wizard to add a new Scout server service. 
 
The different colored tree nodes discussed above are all represented by their individual Eclipse plugins. 
This includes the orange client node, the white UI nodes, the orange mobile client node, the green shared node and the blue server node. 
A Scout Swing client for example contains the plugins \element{org.eclipsescout.helloworld.client}, \element{org.eclipsescout.helloworld.shared} and \element{org.eclipsescout.helloworld.client.ui.swing} but not the other UI technology plugins. 
The Scout server contains the \element{org.eclipsescout.helloworld.server} plugin and the \element{org.eclipsescout.helloworld.shared} plugin. 

% --------------------------------------------------------------------------- %
\section{The Scout Object Properties}

The Scout Object Properties view provides direct access to configurable properties and operations for the element selected in the Scout Explorer.
Before we discuss the typical layout of an object property view we describe the special case of the property view for a complete Scout application. 
This property view is displayed when the application's top level node is selected in the Scout Explorer as shown in \figref{sdk_initial_helloworld_project}. 

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=7cm]{properties_technologies.png}
\caption{The Scout Object Properties showing the expanded Technologies section.}
\figlabel{properties_technologies}
\end{figure}

The main elements of the top-level application proprties are the sections \element{Product Launchers} and the \element{Technologies}. 
As the product launcher section with its launcher boxes has alredy been covered in \secref{run_initial} and \secref{run_initial_background} we focus on the technologies section here.
The technologies section allows to add Scout runtime features and functionalities to the Scout application or remove such elements from the application. 

When the selection of a technology checkbox is changed, a message box is shown to the user. 
This box lists all project resources that are changed when the user confirms the action. 
Once the dialog is confirmed, the selected resources are modified by the Scout SDK to add or remove the feature. 

For features containing licences not compatible to the Eclipse Public Licence (EPL) or features in incubation status, the necessary artefacts is not provided as part of the Eclipse Scout installation package. 
Instead, the associated artefacts need to be installed from a remote updated site first. 
Before any non-EPL content is downloaded from the internet, the user needs to review and confirm the associated licence. 
For this, a license confirmation dialog is shown upfront. 
After confirmation, the required files are downloaded and automatically installed in the local Eclipse instance of the developer. 
Usually, the Eclipse IDE needs to restart after a feature is downloaded and installed for the first time. 
Currently, the procedure described above is used for the following technolgies. 

\begin{itemize}
  \item MySQL JDBC Driver for Eclipse Scout
  \item Oracle 11g2 JDBC Driver for Eclipse Scout
  \item PostgresSQL 9 JDBC Driver for Eclipse Scout
  \item Docx4j Support
  \item Rayo Swing Look and Feel for Eclipse Scout
  \item RAP FileChooser Support (Incubation)
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=7cm]{properties_form.png} \hspace{5mm}
\includegraphics[width=7cm]{properties_stringfield.png}
\caption{The Scout Object Properties for a complete form (left) and a string form field (right).}
\figlabel{properties_view_examples}
\end{figure}

For the description of the Scout Object Properties of typical Scout components we use the example views provided in \figref{properties_view_examples}. 
Both Scout Object Properties example views for the desktop form and the message field are take from the ''Hello World!'' application described in \charef{helloworld}. 
As in the case of the top-level node representing the complete Scout application, the typical layout of the Scout Object Properties view is organized into several sections. 
The content and ordering of the property sections always follows the same scheme.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Filter
  \item Links
  \item Properties
  \item Operations
  \item Advanced Properties
  \item Advanced Operations
\end{itemize}

If a folder node (such as the \folder{Forms} under the orange client node), is selected in the Scout Explorer, the Scout Object Properties only shows a filter section with a filter field. 
The content in this filter field then restricts the elements below the folder icon accordingly. 
This feature is especially useful for the development of larger applications containing dozens of forms or services. 

The \element{Links} section provides a set of hyperlinks as shown on the left hand side of \figref{properties_view_examples}. 
The provided links all refer to Java classes and interfaces that related to the Scout component represented by the property view. 

The available properties of a Scout component are listed in sections \element{Properties} and \element{Advanced Properties}. 
Basically, all available Java \java{getConfigured} methods of a Scout component are listed in one of the two sections depending on the frequency of their usage. 
Section \element{Properties} shows the often used properties, while the less frequently used properties are provided in section \element{Advanced Properties}. 
The examples in \figref{properties_view_examples} show the thematical organization of the sections into \element{Appearance}, \element{Layout}, \element{Behaviour} and other groups.

Access to object operations implemented with Java \java{exec} methods is provided in sections \element{Operations} and \element{Advanced Operations}. 
Again, the more and less frequently used operations are assigned to individual sections. 

For all listed properties and operations the corresponding Javadoc is displayed in the form of a tooltip window. 
To display the available Javadoc, move the mouse pointer over the method of interest in the Scout Object Properties\footnote{
This features is work in progress, as for some methods shown in the Scout Object Properties the Javadoc content is not yet available. 
}. 

% organisation of properties and operations defined in file \filename{sdkPropertyViewConfig.xml} 
% of plugin \filename{org.eclipse.scout.sdk.ui_3.9.0.20130529-1904.jar}
% might be worth a footnote or similar?

So far, we did only describe the content and organisation of the Scout Object Properties. 
In the reminder of this section we will describe the procedure to change or update the default values of properties or the default behaviour of Scout components. 
To indicate non-default property values or non-default behaviour, the font of the property or the operation is switched to underlined bold face. 
As an example, consider the property \element{Ask If Need Save} of the desktop form shown on the left side of \figref{properties_view_examples}. 
The bold font visualizes that this does not correspond to the default behaviour of forms. 
And underlining of this property further indicates, that the label has become a clickable link. 
Clicking on this label will load the corresponding method into the Java editor in the Scout SDK. 

To change a property for a specific Scout component just enter a value in the corresponding field or tick/untick the provided checkbox. 
In some cases the value may also be chosen from a dropdown list. 
For the label field shown on the right hand side of \figref{properties_view_examples}, the ''Message'' value refers to the text key to be used in method \java{getConfiguredLabel}. 
To enter a new label text, start typing the desired translated label and pick the option ''New translated text...''. 

To reset a property or operation to its default value/behaviour, you may click on the red \icon{Minus} provided on the right side of the property field. 
This will remove the overridden method from the object's Java code. 

% --------------------------------------------------------------------------- %
\section{Scout SDK Wizards}

The Scout SDK wizards allow the developer to create Scout application model components with just a few clicks. 
Creation wizards are provided for all major model components such as forms on the client side and services on the server side. 
The usage of wizards not only makes developing Scout applications efficient but also helps to create robust code and reduces the number of errors. 

Scout SDK wizards can do many things. 
They add and update Java classes, register services in the \filename{plugin.xml} files, manage plugin dependencies in the \filename{MANIFEST.MF} files and update Eclipse product files when necessary. 
All these capabilities hide a lot of the complexity of writing Eclipse based applications. 
This simplifies the developing of Scout application considerably.

In the text below, descriptions of the most commonly used Scout SDK wizards are provided. 
First, the wizards to create and export complete Scout applications are described. 
Then, the wizards to create Scout application model components are introduced. 

% --------------------------------------------------------------------------- %
\subsection{Creating a new Scout Project}

The \wizard{New Scout Project} allows to create a new Scout client server application. 
In the Scout Explorer, the \contextmenu{New Scout Project...} is provided on the top-level \folder{Scout Projects}. 
The creation of a form based Scout application has already been introduced in \secref{create_project_simple} for the ''Hello World'' tutorial.
And \secref{create_project_simple_background} provides background information related to the artefacts created by this wizard. 
In the text below, we will described the different steps of the creation wizard individually.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=7cm]{wizard_new_project_1.png} \hspace{5mm}
\includegraphics[width=7cm]{wizard_new_project_2.png}
\caption{The Scout SDK wizard to create a new Scout application.
The first wizard dialog (left) is used to specify the needed application plugins. 
In the next wizard step (right) the application template is selected.}
\figlabel{wizard_new_project}
\end{figure}

In the first wizard step shown on the left side of \figref{wizard_new_project}, it is possible to choose the project name and and the application plugins to create.
The \field{Project Name} is used as base name of the application's plugins and as the Java package base names inside of the plugins. 
If the project name is written as parts separated by periods, the last part is copied into the \field{Project Alias}.

When building multi module applications, the optional \field{Project Postfix} can be specified to apply a common naming schemes for the different modules.
The resulting application plugins (UI, client, shared, server) are then named following the scheme \java{$<$Project Name$>$.$<$plugin$>$.$<$Project Postfix$>$}. 

In the box below the postfix field the list of application plugins that may be created by this wizard is provided. 
Initially, all possible plugins are checked which is useful to quickly demonstrate a ''Hello World'' application.
However, for a typical setup only a one or two UI plugins will be needed. 
To develop a mobile/web applications only the RAP UI plugin is necessary. 
For a desktop only client, either the Swing or the the SWT UI plugin will be needed.
And in cases where the the client needs to run both on the desktop and as a web/mobile application, the RAP and a desktop UI plugin can be choosen. 
A Scout application must not necessarily be a client-server application. 
It is also possible to create a client only or a server only applications. 
But make sure to include the shared plugin in all possible use cases. 

The content of the \field{Alias} is used for the client's executable file, the name of the servlet representing the Scout server application and to build the product launcher names. 
And if the \field{Use default Scout JDT preferences} is checked, the Scout default Java development settings are used. 
Otherwise, you start with no settings and can apply your own template. 

As we have seen in the ''Hello World'' tutorial, it is sufficient to provide a project name in the first wizard step and click on the \button{Finish} to create a form based client server application. 
But we can also click on the \button{Next} to choose an application template.

The second wizard step shown on the right side of \figref{wizard_new_project} allows to choose a Scout application template for the Scout project. 
When choosing the template \textit{Empty Application}, you exactely know what you do and only a minimal code base is created. 
The other two application templates represent different application types. 
The template \textit{Application with a single Form} is the default choice used for the ''Hello World'' tutorial.
Finally, the template \textit{Outline Tree and Table Form} can be used to build explorer like applications. 
The outline tree is typically used to navigate between related buiness entities. 
And the tables are used to list a number of business entities with their attributes. 
We will use this template for the creation of a larger Scout application in \charef{large_example}. 
As in the case of the first wizard step, you may click \button{Finish} to start the creation of an initial Scout application. 
Or, click on \button{Next} and manually step through the third and last wizard step. 

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=9cm]{wizard_new_project_3.png}
\caption{The last wizard step is used to specify the RAP target for the new Scout application.}
\figlabel{wizard_new_project_rap_target}
\end{figure}

The third wizard step shown in \figref{wizard_new_project_rap_target} is only available if the RAP UI plugin has been checked in Step 1.
Because the RAP runtime must not be installed into the running Eclipse instance\footnote{
Why?
}, 
a separate target platform is created and/or used by the Scout SDK. 
This target platform then contains all necessary plugins to run the Scout RAP UI. 
The different options provided by this wizard step are the following.

When choosing the option \textit{Create new RAP Target}, a new RAP target platform will be created at the location specified. 
This target platform is then created by the Scout SDK in the given directory and used by all application plugins.

Option \textit{Download RAP Target} will downloaded the target platform into the running workspace. 
This download will then only be available to the active workspace.
The two download types are only download the RAP plugins (checkbox not ticked) and download a new Kepler Eclipse platform as well (checkox ticked). 
    
With the option \textit{Existing RAP Target} an existing RAP target location can be specified. 
The wizard then detects whether the provided location contains a complete target platform or only the RAP target plugins. 
If a complete platform is detected, only the directory specified is used as the target platform. 
Otherwise, the plugins available to the running Eclipse and the content of the provided directory jointly define the target platform.

To manually define a RAP target platform choose option \textit{I'll do it later}. 
With this option, the Scout SDK does not create a RAP target platform for you. 
But note that the created project will not compile before a complete target platform has been created for the Scout application.  

% --------------------------------------------------------------------------- %
\subsection{Exporting a Scout Project}

The \wizard{Export a Scout Project} allows to export a complete Scout client server application as WAR files. 
In the Scout Explorer, the \contextmenu{Export Scout Project...} is provided on the main application node just below the top-level \folder{Scout Projects}.
